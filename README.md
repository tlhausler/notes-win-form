# Notes Windows Form App

## Context

This was a non-school project I made out of interest.  I always wanted to know how to produce programs that had an interface like the Windows Form ones, so I sought out a project to create to get experience with exactly that. I ended up choosing a note taking application in order to get a feel for making windows forms and how they are programmed.

## Action

The application is a single windows form.  I first arranged the form's layout.  The included functionality would be a set of buttons to add, delete, edit, or save notes, a text field to name the note, a multi-line textbox field where the note is typed, and a data grid view to the side that would display the saved notes by their title.  From the data grid view, one can select and edit or delete existing notes.  I programmed the buttons to fit their intended functionality.

## Result and Reflection

It was a fairly simple application to make and it serves the intended functionality.  I learned some basics of programming windows forms which I found enjoyable.  There are much cleaner and modern notes apps out there and I'm not sure I would expand upon this one, but it was fun to learn.
